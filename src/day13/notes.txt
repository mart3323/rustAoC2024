I think this is solvable with unsigned ints

Consider that we only need to figure out one axis, the other can be calculated trivially from it

To find the correct nr of button 1 presses
  Denote: x1, y1 are the motions awarded by button 1
          x2, y2 are the motions awarded by button 2
          t1, t2 are the target coordinates

Observe that if we input the correct number of presses for button 1, 
then the target must be exactly in the direction that button 2 moves towards.
More specifically, the ratio between the distance on the x and y axis must be exactly
the same as the ratio by which button 2 moves on those axis

Example:
  target: (14,12)
  button1: (+3, +1)
  button2: (+1, +4)

  with 0 presses: (14,12) : ratio 7/6 ~ 1.16
  with 1 press:   (11,11) : ratio   1 = 1.0
  with 2 presses: (8, 10) : ratio 4/5 = 0.8
  with 3 presses: (5, 9)  : ratio 5/9 ~ 0.55
  with 4 presses: (2, 8)  : ratio 1/4 <----------------------

  To line ourselves up for button 2, we need to be 4 times as
  far from the goal on the y axis as we are on the X axis.
  This happens with exactly 4 presses

We can express this as a formula:
  x2(yt-y1k) = y2(xt-x1k)

Shuffling the terms around to calculate k (the number of button 1 presses) yields

  (x1*y2 - x2*y1)k = y2*xt - yt*x2
  k = (y2*xt - yt*x2) / (x1*y2 - x2*y1) 

Why is this safe for unsigned ints?
* Multiplications are always safe, since two positive numbers multiply to another positive
    exception: Risk of overflow

* Division is safe if the result is a whole number (guaranteed by problem statement)
  and if the result is positive (guaranteed by problem statement)
  
* Subtractions are safe if the first operand is larger than the second. 
  Because the final result must be positive, either both subtractions must give a negative result or neither
  If both are negative, then we can flip the order of operands in both to make them both postitive.
  Because we immediately divide the results, this does not affect the final answer
  Simplification: In both cases, subtract the larger number from the smaller.
